```
🚀 Excited to announce AgentOps Client v0.2.0 is now live on PyPI!

After months of development, I've published my first Python package - a reliability monitoring SDK for LLM agents.

🎯 What it does:
• Detects hallucinations in AI responses (RAG & non-RAG modes)
• Tracks latency & throughput for production monitoring
• Provides explainable metrics for every response
• Thread-safe session management

📦 Try it now:
pip install agentops-client

Built with OpenAI's APIs, it combines semantic analysis, uncertainty detection, and factual verification into a single SDK.

Perfect for anyone building production LLM applications who needs Datadog-style observability for AI systems.

### Main Announcement
```
🎉 Just published agentops-client on PyPI! 

A reliability toolkit for LLM agents - monitor hallucinations, latency & throughput in real-time.

pip install agentops-client

Built with @OpenAI APIs. MIT licensed.

### Technical Thread (1/3)
```
🧵 Building agentops-client taught me a ton about packaging Python projects:

1/ Publishing to PyPI isn't scary! Used:
- pyproject.toml for modern packaging
- twine for secure uploads
- pytest for comprehensive testing (25 tests!)

2/ The SDK does dual-mode hallucination detection:
- RAG mode: Evidence-based fact checking
- No-RAG mode: Semantic + uncertainty analysis
- Both track latency & throughput

3/ Key learning: Start with a good README, write tests early, and make it pip-installable from day one.

Try it: pip install agentops-client
```

### Quick Feature Post
```
New to monitoring LLM agents? 

agentops-client gives you:
✅ Hallucination detection
✅ Latency tracking  
✅ Throughput metrics
✅ Session management

All in 3 lines of code:

from agentops import AgentOps
ops = AgentOps()
result = ops.evaluate(prompt, response)

**Subject: Launched My First Python Package! 🎉**

```
Hey [Name],

I wanted to share some exciting news - I just published my first Python package to PyPI!

It's called agentops-client, and it's a monitoring SDK for LLM agents. Think Datadog, but specifically for AI systems.

What it does:
- Detects hallucinations in AI responses
- Tracks performance metrics (latency, throughput)
- Works with or without RAG
- Production-ready with comprehensive tests

You can check it out here:
- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/agentops-client/
- GitHub: https://github.com/ezazahamad2003/agentops

If you're working with LLMs or know someone who is, I'd love to hear feedback!

Installation is just: pip install agentops-client

Thanks for your support!

Best,
Ezaz

**What it is:**
A reliability monitoring SDK for LLM agents that detects hallucinations and tracks performance metrics.

**Key features:**
- Dual-mode hallucination detection (with/without RAG)
- Latency and throughput tracking
- Thread-safe session management
- Comprehensive test suite (25 tests)
- MIT licensed

**Installation:**
```pip install agentops-client```

**Links:**

- GitHub: https://github.com/ezazahamad2003/agentops
- Docs: Full SDK guide in the repo

Built with OpenAI APIs, numpy, and a lot of learning about Python packaging!

Happy to answer any questions about the implementation or the PyPI publishing process.
```

### r/MachineLearning
**Title: "[P] AgentOps Client - Open-source reliability monitoring for LLM agents"**

```
Released an open-source SDK for monitoring LLM agent reliability.

Combines semantic drift analysis, uncertainty detection, and factual verification to identify hallucinations. Also tracks latency/throughput for production monitoring.

Works in two modes:
1. RAG mode - evidence-based fact checking against retrieved docs
2. No-RAG mode - self-check using semantic analysis

MIT licensed, pip-installable: https://pypi.org/project/agentops-client/

Looking for feedback and contributors!

## 📊 Hacker News

**Title: "Show HN: AgentOps Client – Reliability monitoring SDK for LLM agents"**

```
Hi HN,

I built agentops-client, an open-source SDK for monitoring LLM agent reliability in production.

The problem: LLMs hallucinate, and tracking their reliability at scale is hard.

The solution: A Python SDK that combines:
- Semantic drift detection
- Uncertainty analysis
- Factual verification (with or without RAG)
- Performance metrics (latency, throughput)

It's MIT licensed and on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/agentops-client/

GitHub: https://github.com/ezazahamad2003/agentops

Technical stack: OpenAI APIs for embeddings/LLM calls, numpy for computations, pytest for testing.

Would love feedback from folks building production LLM systems!
